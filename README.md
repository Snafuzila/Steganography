## 1. 🧾 General Background

The need for privacy, confidentiality, and secure information transmission has become more prevalent in the digital age.  
This project involves developing a system that implements **steganography principles** — concealing information inside digital files in a way that is invisible to the eye.

The system will allow users to **embed files or text** into various formats such as images, audio files, videos, and documents — using dedicated hiding algorithms, **without visibly altering the file**.

Additionally, the project includes developing a **user-friendly interface** and the ability to **extract hidden information**, with **optional encryption** and basic content protection.

## 2. 🎯 Objectives and Goals

### 🎯 **Project Objective**
Build a complete steganographic system that enables **transparent data hiding** (text, files) in various formats, while **preserving the integrity** of the outer file.

### ✅ **Main Goals**
- Develop dedicated algorithms for **data hiding and extraction**
- Support the following formats: `PNG`, `BMP`, `WAV`, `FLAC`, `AVI`, `MKV`, `PDF`, `DOCX`
- Build an **internal encryption mechanism (AES-256)** to maintain confidentiality
- Develop a **user-friendly interface** (initially CLI, potentially GUI later)
- Document all code and algorithms clearly
- Perform **tests and experiments** using various file types

## 3. 🧪 Technological Overview

### 🐍 **Programming Language**
- **Python** – Chosen for its strong support in digital file processing, encryption, UI frameworks, and vast library ecosystem.

### 📚 **Relevant Libraries (selected or under consideration)**
- `Pillow` – Image file processing  
- `PyDub`, `wave` – Audio file handling  
- `PyCryptodome` – Encryption  
- `PyMuPDF`, `python-docx` – Document (PDF, DOCX) handling  
- `Tkinter` or `PyQt` – GUI interface (if GUI development is selected)

### 📂 **Supported Formats**
- **Images:** PNG, BMP  
- **Audio:** WAV, FLAC  
- **Video:** AVI, MKV  
- **Text/Documents:** PDF, DOCX

### 🧠 **Selected Algorithms**
- **LSB (Least Significant Bit):** For embedding in images, video, and audio  
- **Whitespace Steganography:** For hiding text in document formats  
- **Echo Hiding:** For embedding messages in audio files  
- **DSS (Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum):** Hiding information in audio and video signals

---

## 🔮 Future Implementation Recommendations
- Share code and logic between handling `WAV` and `FLAC` (Echo Hiding)
- Explore and evaluate existing Python libraries such as `pydub`, `PyPDF2`, `python-docx`
- Organize the project using **modular structure** – one class/module per format
- Create **test cases** to validate that the **original content is not altered**
